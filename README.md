Landing page for vocal courses made with «Bootstrap 4». Responsive, mobile-first.

This is my first full-fledged project that I made for my friend. 
I'm not really happy with the design of desktop version, because it was mostly made for mobile version and was promoted in Instagram.
Yellow buttons are linked to the pages with widgets, where user can make a payment via Yandex Money service.
I also used external service for the contact form.
